p8105\_hw3\_xw2676.Rmd
================

## Problem1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

There are 1384617 observations and 15 variables in instacart dataset.
The key variables are reordered，days\_since\_prior\_order,
product\_name, aisle, department. For example, there is a customer whose
id is 112108 bought an order whose id is 1 in 10:00 am Thursday. Among
these products, such as yogurt or cheese, there are 4 products that he
have bought before. And this order is his fourth order. It has been 9
days ever since his prior
order.

#### 1）

``` r
aisle_data_ordered = group_by(instacart,aisle,aisle_id) %>% ## split data into datasets of different aisles
  summarise(n = n()) %>% ## generate a dataset which comprises of every aisle and number of items ordered from it.
  arrange(-n)
  ##make this dataset arranged in order from big to small.
```

So there are 134 aisles, and items are ordered mostly from “fresh
vegetables” aisle. The reason for this may be that fresh vegetables are
must for every person, and people must buy much of them every
day.

#### 2\)

``` r
items_aisle = filter(aisle_data_ordered, n>10000) %>%  ## filter the aisles from which the number of items ordered is larger than 10000.
ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +     ## make a geom_point plot.
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Number of items ordered from each aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "Number of items ordered from each aisle",
    caption = "Data from the instacart package"
  )+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 1))
items_aisle
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_xw2676_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />
From the plot above, we can see that “fresh fruits” and “fresh
vegetables” are the aisles from which most items bought. The reason is
the same as the first question: fresh vegetables and fresh fruits are a
must for every person, and people must buy much of them every day.

#### 3）

``` r
## generate table of three most popular items in baking ingredients.
baking_ingredients = filter(instacart, aisle == "baking ingredients") %>% 
  group_by(product_name) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = "baking ingredients")
## generate table of three most popular items in dog food care.
dog_food_care = filter(instacart, aisle == "dog food care") %>% 
  group_by(product_name) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = "dog food care")
## generate table of three most popular items in packaged vegetables fruits.
packaged_vegetables_fruits = filter(instacart, aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") %>% 
  group_by(product_name) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = "packaged vegetables fruits")
## Combine them together
combined_popular_item = rbind(baking_ingredients,dog_food_care,packaged_vegetables_fruits) %>%  knitr::kable(format = "html")

</table>

From the results above, we can see that the three most popular items in
each of the aisles are some basic stuff for baking ingredients, dog food
care and packaged vegetables fruits. And because most people eat
packaged vegetables fruits, so the number of times each item is ordered
from it is the most. And there are less people have pets, so the number
of times each item is ordered from it is the
least.
